# AI-Content Detector

## Project Overview

The **AI-Content Detector** project aims to detect whether a given text is AI-generated or human-written. The project consists of a web-based interface that allows users to input text and checks the content's authenticity using a pre-trained machine learning model on the backend. The interface responds with a "YES" or "NO" based on the prediction.

### Key Features:
- **Frontend**: Built with React for a responsive and clean user interface.
- **Backend**: Uses Flask and a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- **AI Model**: Based on OpenAI’s Roberta model for AI-content detection.
